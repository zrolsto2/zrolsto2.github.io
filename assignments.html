              <br>
              Due: April 27th
            </h2>
            <hr>
            General Guidelines:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Length requirement: strictly between
                <strong>18 and 20 minutes.</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                Everyone in the group must speak in the presentation for at least 2 minutes
                (unless otherwise cleared beforehand with the professor.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Each group's
                <strong>presentation must utilize some form of electronic media.</strong>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">However, the use of videos is prohibited.</span>
                Using a video will result in a significant reduction in the group's grade.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each member of the group will receive the same grade. However, if you
                do not contribute to your group, you can lose points individually.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each presentation should use
                <strong>at least 5 scholarly sources</strong>
                (no wikipedia) your presentation must include a citations slide other
                form of media. Citations must be in Chicago or MLA format.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you are unsure about anything about the presentation, you can come
                by the professors office hours to discuss it.

              Due: May 5th
            </h2>
            <hr>
            Each student must complete a paper of
            <b>no less than 5 pages and no more
        than 7 pages</b>
            .&nbsp;

              <br>
            </div>
            <div>
              The topic for the paper will be an analysis of the state and local election
              process. It can cover elections during any of the historical periods we
              have discussed, or the current election. You must discuss candidates, candidate
              and party platforms, election results, controversies, initiatives on the
              ballot, as well as social and political ramifications at the local, state,
              and national levels.&nbsp;

                  <b>Content</b>
                  : 70 Points. Sources must be scholarly, appropriate, and factual. MSNBC,
                  Fox News, and Wikipedia cannot be used. You will lose 5 points per citation
                  if you violate this policy. Citations must be noted in the text. You may
                  use footnotes for citations. Your paper must be well organized, with clear
                  separation between sections. Organization and structure will account for
                  20 points of your total content. Your paper must include a thesis statement
                  which is worth 5 points. Your paper must be written in formal academic
                  style, do not use personal pronouns (using I, you, or we). Your paper should
                  be written in the 3rd person point of view. You may conduct personal interviews
                  for your paper but you must follow proper Chicago or MLA formatting for
                  conducting and citing interviews.&nbsp;

                    You must use paragraphs of no less than 4 sentences. Your paper should
                    be factual, present complete arguments and avoid bias. Failure to present
                    proper content in your paper will result in a loss of points in relation
                    to size of, or frequency of the mistakes.&nbsp;

                      <b>Grammar</b>

                      sentence structure, etc. Each mistake will incur a penalty of 1 point.
                      You can lose a maximum of 10 points from grammatical mistakes.&nbsp;

                  Citation Page</b>
                        : 10 Points. Citations must be in MLA or Chicago format. You will lose
                        1 point for mistakes in citation format up to a maximum of 10 points.&nbsp;

                    Formatting</b>
                          : 10 Points. Your paper must be in 12 point, times new Roman or Liberation
                          Serif (for Linux users) font. 5-7 pages double spaced. This does not include
                          your cover or citations page. I want 5-7 pages of content. 1 inch margins
                          are required. You must include a cover page which includes your name, Blinn
                          ID number, section, class start time, date, and Govt 2306. Failure to do
                          any of these things will result in 10 points being being deducted.&nbsp;
